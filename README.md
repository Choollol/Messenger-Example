# Messenger-Example

This repository is a reference for the Unity Messenger System Documentation which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JoiURcQxYknvDlhJPOnOCaJGMLsFv32iPlezUkGKPaY/edit?usp=sharing).

It is not a full Unity project as this repo only contains the code for each messenger script. Instructions on how to use them can be found in the link above.
